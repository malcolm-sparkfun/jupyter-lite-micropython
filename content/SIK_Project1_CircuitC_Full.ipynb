    "# Project 1 - Circuit 1C: Photoresistor\n",
    "\n",
    "In circuit 1B, you got to use a potentiometer, which varies resistance based on the twisting of a knob. In this circuit you’ll be using a photoresistor, which changes resistance based on how much light the sensor receives. Using this sensor you can make a simple night-light that turns on when the room gets dark and turns off when it is bright.\n",

    "## New Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Photoresistor\n",
    "Photoresistors, or [photocells](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/photocell-hookup-guide), are light-sensitive, variable resistors. As more light shines on the sensor’s head, the resistance between its two terminals decreases. They’re an easy-to-use component in projects that require ambient-light sensing.\n",

    "## New Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analog to Digital Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "The world we live in is analog, but the RedBoard lives in a digital world. In order to have the RedBoard sense analog signals, we must first pass them through an [Analog to Digital Converter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-to-digital-conversion) (or ADC). The six analog inputs (A0--A5) covered in the last circuit all use an ADC. These pins \"sample\" the analog signal and create a digital signal for the microcontroller to interpret. The \"resolution\" of this signal is based on the resolution of the ADC. In the case of the RedBoard, that resolution is 16-bit. With a 16-bit ADC, we get 2 ^ 16 = 65536 possible values, which is why the analog signal varies between 0 and 65535.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voltage Divider Continued\n",
    "Since the RedBoard can’t directly interpret resistance (rather, it reads voltage), we need to use a [voltage divider](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers) to use our photoresistor, a part that doesn't output voltage. The resistance of the photoresistor changes as it gets darker or lighter. That changes the amount of voltage that is read on the analog pin, which \"divides\" the voltage, 5V in this case. That divided voltage is then read on the analog to digital converter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![VDivSchematic](images/sik-docs-prj1-cb-vdiv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![VDivPhoto](images/sik-docs-prj1-cc-vdiv-photo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Top: A regular voltage divider circuit. Vout will be a constant voltage. Bottom: A variable voltage divider circuit. Vout will fluctuate as the resistance of the photoresistor changes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The voltage divider equation assumes that you know three values of the above circuit: the input voltage (Vin), and both resistor values (R1 and R2). Given those values, we can use this equation to find the output voltage (Vout):\n",
    "\n",
    "![VDivEq](images/sik-docs-prj1-cc-equation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If R1 is a constant value (the resistor) and R2 fluctuates (the photoresistor), the amount of voltage measured on the Vout pin will also fluctuate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Hookup\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the photoresistor is not polarized. It can be inserted in either direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to start hooking everything up? Check out the circuit diagram and hookup table below to see how everything is connected.\n",
