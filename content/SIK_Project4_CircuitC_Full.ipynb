    "# Project 4 - Circuit 4C: DIY Who Am I? Game\n",
    "\n",
    "\"DIY Who Am I?\" is based on the popular [Hedbanz](http://www.hedbanz.com/) game or [HeadsUp!](https://www.warnerbros.com/videogame/heads) app. It's a fun party game in which a player holds an LCD screen to his/her forehead so that the player can’t see the word(s) that appear on the screen. Other players have to give hints, act out charades or make noises that will make the player with the LCD guess the word(s).\n",

    "## New Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4xAA Battery Holder\n",
    "Included in your kit is a 4-cell AA battery holder. The 5-inch cable is terminated with a standard barrel jack connector. The connector mates with the barrel jack on the RedBoard, allowing you to easily make your project battery powered.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Battery Pack](images/sik-docs-prj4-cb-battery-pack.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## New Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Button Debounce\n",
    "When working with momentary buttons, it is usually necessary to add button debouncing to your code. This is because the code that is meant to execute when the button is pressed may execute faster than you can press and release the button (microcontrollers are fast!). The simplest way to debounce a button is to add a small delay to the end of your code. This script adds a 500 millisecond delay at the end of the infinite loop to account for this. This simple addition will prevent a word from getting skipped when you press the button for the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Magic\" Save Command\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks do not have a built-in way to \"save\" or \"flash\" code to a device, meaning put code on a device that will run automatically whenever the RedBoard is restarted. That is why we have added a \"Magic\" command for saving code to your RedBoard. This is a command that isn't a built-in part of Python or Jupyter notebooks, but is specific to SparkFun Jupyter Notebooks. To save all the code from a cell to a device, put this exact line in your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "# %save%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are connected to your device, this command should save all of the other code that is below it in a cell. This will replace all the code that is currently saved to the device, so to save an entire program, we must put it all in the same cell under the `# %save%` line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists of Strings\n",
    "In circuit 2A you used a list of characters to represent musical notes. In this program, you’ll want to make a list of strings. Strings use multiple characters to make words.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "listOfStrings = [“Feynman” “Sagan”, “Tyson”, “Nye”]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Hookup\n",
    "\n",
    "Batteries are polarized. They have a positive end and a negative end. The battery holder has images indicating which end goes in which orientation for each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "![BatteryPolarity](images/sik-docs-prj4-cc-battery-pol.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure all the batteries are inserted correctly before plugging the battery holder into the RedBoard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Battery Holder Attachment\n",
    "To attach the battery holder to the breadboard baseplate, first cut two strips of Dual Lock that are roughly 1 inch x 1 inch each, or 2.5cm x 2.5cm. Remove the adhesive backing and attach one piece to the back of the battery holder.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Battery Dual Lock](images/sik-docs-prj4-cc-battery-dl.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adhere the second piece to the bottom of the breadboard baseplate (directly in the middle is recommended, as this will come into play in Project 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Baseplate Dual Lock](images/sik-docs-prj4-cc-bp-dl.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, press the battery holder to the baseplate so that the two pieces of Dual Lock snap together. Insert the batteries into the holder if you have not done so already. Remember that batteries are polarized and can only go in one way.\n",
    "\n",

    "Remove the battery pack while building your circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Should we even have the below note?\n",
    "NOTE: If you would like, feel free to get creative with some of the dual lock tape, the binder clip, screws, or any other method you see fit to attach the OLED to your baseplate. This is not mandatory, but is somewhat nice for holding the game up to your head while playing. NOTE: DO NOT WASTE ANYMORE THAN A 1\"x1\" SECTION OF DUAL LOCK TO ATTACH THE OLED. MOST OF THE DUAL LOCK IS USED FOR THE ROBOT IN PROJECT 5.\n",

    "The game will begin with a prompt telling you the category of words. Then it will run through a short countdown. When the first round starts, the word to be guessed will be displayed in the top left, and a countdown will be displayed in the bottom right of the LCD screen. Each time the button is pressed (before the timer expires) a new word will be displayed. If you win or lose, a short song will play and text will be displayed. Unplug and replug the battery pack or click the \"RESET\" buton on the RedBoard to restart the game.\n",
