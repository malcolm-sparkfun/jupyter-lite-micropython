In this activity you will also use the OLED screen to display sensor readings, a common use for OLEDs in electronics projects.\n",

    "### TMP36 Temperature Sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "This temperature sensor has three legs. One connects to 5V, one to ground, and the voltage output from the third leg varies proportionally to changes in temperature. By doing some simple math with this voltage we can measure temperature in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n",

    "### Algorithms\n",
    "An algorithm is a process used in order to achieve a desired result. Often, the information needed to create an algorithm lives in the part's datasheet. This sketch uses a few formulas to turn a voltage value into a temperature value, making them all part of the larger temperature-retrieving algorithm. The first formula takes the voltage read on analog pin 0 and multiplies it to get a voltage value from 0V--5V:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "voltage = tempSensor.read_u16() * (3.3 / 65536.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We convert the analog \"count\" from the temperature sensor that gets returned by `read_u16()` to a voltage by multiplying by the maximum possible voltage (3.3 V) and dividing by the number of different possible counts (since read_u16() returns a 16-bit value that is 2^16 = 65536)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next formula takes that 0--5V value and calculateds degrees Centigrade:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "degreesC = (voltage - 0.5) * 100.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "The reason 0.5V is subtracted from the calculated voltage is because there is a 0.5V offset, mentioned on page 8 of the [TMP36 datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temp/TMP35_36_37.pdf). It's then multiplied by 100 to get a value that matches temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last formula takes the Centigrade temperature and converts it to a Fahrenheit temperature using the standard conversion formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "degreesF = degreesC * (9.0 / 5.0) + 32.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these three formulas make up the algorithm that converts from the analog input counts to degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Hookup\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature sensor is polarized and can only be inserted in one direction. See below for the pin outs of the temperature sensor. Pay very close attention to the markings on each side as you insert it into your circuit.\n",
