    "### \"Magic\" Save Command\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks do not have a built-in way to \"save\" or \"flash\" code to a device, meaning put code on a device that will run automatically whenever the RedBoard is restarted. That is why we have added a \"Magic\" command for saving code to your RedBoard. This is a command that isn't a built-in part of Python or Jupyter notebooks, but is specific to SparkFun Jupyter Notebooks. To save all the code from a cell to a device, put this exact line in your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "# %save%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are connected to your device, this command should save all of the other code that is below it in a cell. This will replace all the code that is currently saved to the device, so to save an entire program, we must put it all in the same cell under the `# %save%` line.\n",

    "### Autonomous Vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot that you will build uses a simple sensor to avoid obstacles. This kind of system is used in Mars rovers, autonomous cars and the bots built for all kinds of robotics competitions. Understanding this example code will set you on the path to building bigger and better autonomous vehicles!\n",

We'll put together our motor functions from Circuit 5B with our distance sensing functions from Project 3 to save code to our robot that makes the robot back up and turn when it encounters a wall. Run the cell below to save this code to your board and then unplug it, plug in the battery pack and watch it go!"

    "Troubleshooting Warning: HVAC systems in offices and schools have been known to interfere with the performance of the ultrasonic distance sensor. If you are experiencing sporadic behavior from your circuit, check your surroundings. If there are numerous air ducts in the room you are using, try moving to a different room that does not have ducts. The airflow from these ducts can interfere with the waves sent from the sensor, creating noise and resulting in bad readings.\n",
