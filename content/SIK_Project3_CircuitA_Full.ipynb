    "# Project 3 - Circuit 3A: Servo Motors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this circuit, you will learn how to wire a servo and control it with code. Servo motors can be told to move to a specific position and stay there. Low-cost servo motors were originally used to steer remote-controlled airplanes and cars, but they have become popular for any project where precise movement is needed.\n",

    "Regular DC motors have two wires. When you hook the wires up to power, the motor spins around and around. [Servo motors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hobby-servo-tutorial), on the other hand, have three wires: one for power, one for ground and one for signal. When you send the right signal through the signal wire, the servo will move to a specific angle and stay there. Common servos rotate over a range of 0° to 180°. The signal that is sent is a PWM signal, the same used to control the RGB LED in Project 1.\n",

    "### Duty Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) hardware available on a microcontroller is a great way to generate servo control signals. When talking about how long a PWM signal is on, this is referred to as [duty cycle](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation#duty-cycle). Duty cycle is measured in percentage. The percentage of duty cycle specifically describes the percentage of time a digital signal is on over an interval or period of time. The variation in the duty cycle tells the servo which position to go to in its rotation.\n",

    "Writing code that sends precise PWM signals to the servo would be time consuming and would require a lot more knowledge about the servo. Luckily, MicroPython has hundreds of built-in and user-submitted containers of code that are called modules or libraries. Lets use the following user-submitted servo library. \n",
