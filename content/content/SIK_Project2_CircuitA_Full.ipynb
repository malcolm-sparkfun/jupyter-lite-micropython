    "# Project 2 - Circuit 2A: Buzzer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this circuit, you'll use the RedBoard and a small buzzer to make music, and you'll learn how to program your own songs using lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "![What you need](images/sik-demo-prj2-ca-need.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## New Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buzzer\n",
    "\n",
    "The buzzer uses a small magnetic coil to vibrate a metal disc inside a plastic housing. By pulsing electricity through the coil at different rates, different frequencies (pitches) of sound can be produced. Attaching a potentiometer to the output allows you to limit the amount of current moving through the buzzer and lower its volume.\n",

    "\n",
    "## New Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reset Button\n",
    "\n",
    "The RedBoard has a built-in reset button. This button will reset the board and start the code over from the beginning, running what is in setup() and then loop().\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Swap out with RP2350 photo\n",
    "\n",
    "![Reset](images/sik-docs-prj2-ca-reset.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Playing Sound with PWM\n",
    "To control the buzzer, we will use the same `PWM` functionality that we used to control the RGB LEDs. By passing different frequencies and durations to our PWM we can play different tones for different lengths of time from our buzzer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "[Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) are used like variables, but they can store multiple values. Imagine that you want to store the frequency for each note of the C major scale. We could make seven variables and assign a frequency to each one, or we could use an list and store all seven in the same list, as shown below. To refer to a specific value in the list, an index number is used. lists are indexed from 0. For example, to call the first element in the list, use `list_name[0]` to call the second element, `use list_name[1]` and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Musical Note | Frequency (Hz) | Using Variables | Using an Array   |\n",
    "|--------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| A            | 220           | aFrequency     | frequency[0]     |\n",
    "| B            | 247           | bFrequency     | frequency[1]     |\n",
    "| C            | 261           | cFrequency     | frequency[2]     |\n",
    "| D            | 294           | dFrequency     | frequency[3]     |\n",

    "\n",
    "### `len()` function\n",
    "To get the length of a list (and many other types of objects in python) you can call `len()` on it. For example, to get the length of a list called `myList` we could use: `len(myList)` and the length would be returned. This is helpful when searching through all of the elements of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Hookup\n",
    " ⚠️ **Warning For Polarized Components**: Pay special attention to the component’s markings indicating how to place it on the breadboard. Polarized components can only be connected to a circuit in one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The buzzer is polarized. To see which leg is positive and which is negative, flip the buzzer over and look at the markings underneath. Keep track of which pin is where, as they will be hard to see once inserted into the breadboard. There is also text on the positive side of the buzzer, along with a tiny (+) symbol.\n",

    "![ProfileBuzzer](images/sik-demo-prj2-ca-prof-buzzer.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volume Knob\n",
    "All of the circuits in Project 2 make use of a potentiometer as a rudimentary volume knob. Notice that only two of the potentiometer's legs are used in these circuits. In these instances, the potentiometer is acting as a variable resistor, limiting the amount of current flowing to the speaker and thus affecting the volume as you turn the knob. This is similar to the current-limiting resistor used to limit current to the LED in circuit 1A --- only this time the resistance is variable.\n",
