    "# Project 2 - Circuit 2C: Simon Says Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The Simon Says game uses LEDs to flash a pattern, which the player must remember and repeat using four buttons. The classic [Simon game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) has been a hit since the 1980s. Now you can build your own!\n",

    "TODO: Should these be moved to circuit A which already has a for loop?\n",
    "### For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "[For loops](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements) repeat a section of code a set number of times. The loop works by using a counter (usually programmers use the letter “i” for this variable) that increases each loop until it reaches a stop value. Here’s an example of a simple for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop takes a `list` of values and will execute the code insde the loop for each value in the list. In this case, we create the list with the `range()` function. Since we specified \"5\" as the argument to the `range()` function, it will create a list of 5 numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Remember python is 0 indexed. So the code in the loop will run 5 times, once for each of these numbers. Each time the loop runs, the variable `i` will be set to the current number. The only code in our loop is the `print()` function. So when the entire loop runs, our `print()` function will print `0 1 2 3 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Durations of Time with ticks_us\n",
    "The RedBoard has a built-in clock that keeps accurate time. You can use the `ticks_ms()` function of the built-in `time` module to see how many milliseconds have passed since the RedBoard was last powered. By storing the time when an event happens and then subtracting the current time, you can measure the number of milliseconds (and thus seconds) that have passed. To tell the difference between two times obtained with `ticks_ms()`, we can use `ticks_diff(end_time, start_time)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Functions\n",
    "These functions perform operations that are needed many times in the program (for example, reading which button is currently pressed or turning all of the LEDs off). Functions are essential to make more complex programs readable and compact.\n",

If you repeat the pattern correctly by pressing the corresponding colored button, then the game will move to the next round and add another color to the pattern sequence. If you make a mistake, the loss melody will play. If you get to round 10, the win melody will play. Press any button to start a new game.\n",
