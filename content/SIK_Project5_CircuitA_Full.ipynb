    "# Project 5 - Circuit 5A: Motor Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this circuit you will learn the basic concepts behind motor control. Motors require a lot of current, so you can’t drive them directly from a digital pin on the RedBoard. Instead, you’ll use what is known as a motor controller or motor driver board to power and spin the motor accordingly.\n",

    "### Switch\n",
    "\n",
    "A [switch](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/button-and-switch-basics/all) is a component that controls the open-ness or closed-ness of an electric circuit. Just like the momentary buttons used in earlier circuits, a switch can only exist in one of two states: open or closed. However, a switch is different in that it will stay in the position it was last in until it is switched again.\n",

    "### DC Gearmotors\n",
    "\n",
    "The [motors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/motors-and-selecting-the-right-one) in your Inventor’s Kit have two main parts: a small DC motor that spins quickly and a plastic gearbox that gears down that output from the hobby motor so that it is slower but stronger, allowing it to move your robot. The motors have a clever design so that you can attach things that you want to spin fast (like a small fan or flag) to the hobby motor, and things that you want to be strong (like a wheel) to the plastic axle sticking out the side of the motor. The included wheels just so happen to fit on the plastic axles.\n",

    "![Switch](images/sik-docs-prj5-ca-motors.jpg) ![Wheels](images/sik-docs-prj5-ca-wheels.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the hobby motor are coils of wire that generate magnetic fields when electricity flows through them. When power is supplied to these electromagnets, they spin the drive shaft of the motor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TB6612FNG Motor Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "If you switch the direction of current through a motor by swapping the positive and negative leads, the motor will spin in the opposite direction. Motor controllers contain a set of switches (called an H-bridge) that let you easily control the direction of one or more motors. The [TB6612FNG Motor Driver](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tb6612fng-hookup-guide) takes commands for each motor over three wires (two wires control direction, and one controls speed), then uses these signals to control the current through two wires attached to your motor.\n",

    "\n",
    "TODO: From my testing with a RedBoard RP2350, VIN was reading 0 when powered w/ USB!\n",
    "\n",
    "This circuit utilizes the VIN pin found with the other power pins. The VIN pin outputs a voltage that varies based on whatever voltage the RedBoard is powered with. If the RedBoard is powered through the USB port, then the voltage on VIN will be about 4.6--5V. However, if you power the RedBoard through the [barrel jack](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connector-basics#power-connectors) (highlighted in the picture below), the VIN pin will reflect that voltage. For example, if you were to power the barrel jack with 9V, the voltage out on VIN would also be 9V.\n",

    "### Integrated Circuits (ICs) and Breakout Boards\n",
    "\n",
    "An [Integrated Circuit (IC)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/integrated-circuits) is a collection of electronic components --- resistors, transistors, capacitors, etc. --- all stuffed into a tiny chip and connected together to achieve a common goal. They come in all sorts of flavors, shapes and sizes. The chip that powers the RedBoard, the RP2350, is an IC. The chip on the motor driver, the TB6612FNG, is another IC, one designed to control motors, referred to as an [H-bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_bridge).\n",

    "![IC Example](images/sik-docs-prj5-ca-ic.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "*The guts of an integrated circuit, visible after removing the top.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated circuits are often too small to work with by hand. To make working with ICs easier and to make them breadboard-compatible, they are often added to a breakout board, which is a [printed circuit board](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pcb-basics) that connects all the IC's tiny legs to larger ones that fit in a breadboard. The motor driver board in your kit is an example of a breakout board.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Hookup\n",
