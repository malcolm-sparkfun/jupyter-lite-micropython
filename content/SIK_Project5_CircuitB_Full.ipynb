    "\n",
    "It’s remote control time! In this circuit, you’ll use a motor driver to control the speed and direction of two motors. You will also learn how to read multiple pieces of information from one serial command so that you can use the Serial Monitor to tell the robot what direction to move in and how far to move.\n",

    "### ASCII Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "[ASCII](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/ascii) is a standard formalized in the 1960s that assigns numbers to characters. This is a method of character encoding. When typing on a computer keyboard, each character you type has a number associated with it. This is what allows computers to know whether you are typing a lowercase \"a,\" an uppercase \"A\" or a random character such as ampersand (&). In this experiment, you will be sending characters to the Serial Monitor to move your remote control robot. When you send a character, the microcontroller is actually interpreting that as a specific number. There are tons of ASCII tables available online. These tables make it easier to know which character is represented by which number.\n",

    "### Converting Strings to Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "String variables hold words like “dog” or “Robert Smith” that are made up of multiple characters. Python has a set of special built-in methods for converting between different types of variable such as strings and integers. To convert an integer to a string you can use the `str()` method and to convert from a string to an integer you can use the `int()` method. You can see the type of a variable with the `type()` method.\n",
