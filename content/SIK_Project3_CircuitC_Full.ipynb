    "Time to take your distance sensor project to the next level. Let’s imagine that you want to stop your cat from prowling around your countertop. This circuit will use light, sound and motion to scare away your cat when it is detected by the distance sensor. Using a servo motor, you can add a moving pop-up to animate your alarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t have a cat? No problem! This circuit can be adapted for a variety of projects such as a room alarm, an automated pop-up story, an automatic treat dispenser and so much more. Let your imagination run wild with this project.\n",

    "This circuit gets really fun when you start to use your servo to animate the world around you. To do this, you’ll need to connect your servo to some physical mechanisms. Tape and hot glue are easy ways to connect things to your servo. You can also loop a paper clip through the small holes in the servo arm to serve as a linkage. See the Hardware Hookup section below for more information.\n",

    "If you have opted for the extra materials, use the following instructions to create the moving pop-up for your cat alarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, attach your servo to the baseplate using Dual Lock, as described in Circuit 3A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attach the servo mount of your choice. It is recommended you wait until after you have uploaded your code to ensure the mount is in the best position before screwing on the mount. The screw is optional, but it will make for a more robust mechanism.\n",

    "Next, use needle-nose pliers to bend the paper clip straight. Imagine a 3D space. The straight clip is the X-axis. Bend one end of the paper clip 90 degrees along the Y-axis. The bent segment should be about 1 inch or 2.5cm long. Then bend the other end along the Z-axis. This bend should be about 1/8 inch or 3mm long. Repeat this bend once more back toward the X-axis, making a hook shape. You should now have a linkage rod that looks something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Cut out the pop-up image of your choice. We chose this public domain menacing cat image (http://bit.ly/2vinyE1). The image you choose should be about 2.5 inches x 2.5 inches and can be drawn or printed. Leave a rectangular strip of paper under the image that is about 2 inches long. Fold along the bottom of the image. Tape the pop-up to the underside of the breadbaord baseplate on the same side to which the servo is connected.\n",

    "![PopupBack](images/sik-demo-prj3-cc-back.jpg)\n",

Try pointing your sensor away from the other distance sensors or changing to a different location. |\n",
