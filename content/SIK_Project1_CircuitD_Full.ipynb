    "# Project 1 - Circuit 1D: RGB Night-Light\n",
    "\n",
    "In this circuit, you'll take the night-light concept to the next level by adding an RGB LED, which is three differently colored Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) built into one component. RGB stands for Red, Green and Blue, and these three colors can be combined to create any color of the rainbow!\n",

    "## New Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### RGB LED\n",
    "An RGB LED is actually three small LEDs --- one red, one green and one blue --- inside a normal LED housing. The RGB LED included in this kit has all the internal LEDs share the same ground wire, so there are four legs in total. To turn one color on, ensure ground is connected, then power one of the legs just as you would a regular LED. If you turn on more than one color at a time, you will see the colors start to blend together to form a new color.\n",

    "## New Concepts\n",

    "### Analog Output (Pulse-width Modulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the digital pins with the high() and low() commands to turn pins on the RedBoard on (5V) or off (0V), but what if you want to output 2.5V? The RedBoard doesn't have an Analog Output, but it is really good at switching some digital pins on and off fast enough to simulate an analog output. PWM() can output 2.5 volts by quickly switching a pin on and off so that the pin is only on 50 percent of the time (50% of 5V is 2.5V). By changing the percent of time that a pin is on, from 0 percent (always off) to 100 percent (always on), PWM objects can output any voltage between 0 and 5V. This is what is known as [pulse-width modulation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation) (or PWM). By using PWM, you can create many different colors with the RGB LED.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Your own Simple Functions\n",
    "When programmers want to use a piece of code over and over again, they write a function. The simplest functions are just chunks of code that you give a name to. When you want to run that code, you can “call” the function by typing its name, instead of writing out all of the code. More complicated functions take and return pieces of information from the program (we call these pieces of information parameters). In this circuit, you'll write functions to turn the RGB LED different colors by just typing that color's name.\n",

    "*WARNING: The RGB LED is polarized. It needs to be inserted in the correct direction*\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a regular LED, an RGB LED is polarized and only allows electricity to flow in one direction. Pay close attention to the flat edge and to the different length leads. Both are indicators to help orient the LED correctly.\n",
