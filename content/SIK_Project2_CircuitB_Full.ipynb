    "# Project 2 - Circuit 2B: Digital Trumpet\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn about digital inputs and buttons as you build your own digital trumpet!\n",
    "\n",
    "![What you need](images/sik-demo-prj2-cb-need.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## New Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buttons\n",
    "\n",
    "[Buttons](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/button-and-switch-basics/all), also known as momentary switches, are switches that only remain in their on state as long as they’re being actuated, or pressed. Most often momentary switches are best used for intermittent user-input cases: reset button and keypad buttons. These switches have a nice, tactile, “clicky” feedback when you press them.\n",
    "\n",
    "![buttons](images/sik-docs-prj2-cb-button.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the different colors are just aesthetic. All of the buttons included behave the same no matter their color.\n",
    "\n",
    "## New Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Number System\n",
    "\n",
    "Number systems are the methods we use to represent numbers. We’ve all been mostly operating within the comfy confines of a base-10 number system, but there are many others. The base-2 system, otherwise known as [binary](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/binary), is common when dealing with computers and electronics. There are really only two ways to represent the state of anything: ON or OFF, HIGH or LOW, 1 or 0. And so, almost all electronics rely on a base-2 number system to store and manipulate numbers. The heavy reliance electronics places on binary numbers means it’s important to know how the base-2 number system works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Input\n",
    "\n",
    "In circuit 1A, you worked with digital outputs. This circuit focuses on [digital inputs](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins). Digital inputs only care if something is in one of two states: TRUE or FALSE, HIGH or LOW, ON or OFF. Digital inputs are great for determining if a button has been pressed or if a switch has been flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull-up Resistors\n",
    "\n",
    "A [pull-up resistor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pull-up-resistors) is a small circuit that holds the voltage HIGH (5V) on a pin until a button is pressed, pulling the voltage LOW (0V). The most common place you will see a pull-up resistor is when working with buttons. A pull-up resistor keeps the button in one state until it is pressed. The RedBoard has built-in pull-up resistors, but they can also be added to a circuit externally. This circuit uses the internal pull-up resistors, covered in more detail in the Code to Note section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Hookup\n",
    "\n",
    "Buttons are not polarized. However, they do merit a closer look. Buttons make momentary contact from one connection to another, so why are there four legs on each button? The answer is to provide more stability and support to the buttons in your breadboard circuit. Each row of legs is connected internally. When the button is pressed, one row connects to the other, making a connection between all four pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The buzzer is polarized. To see which leg is positive and which is negative, flip the buzzer over and look at the markings underneath. Keep track of which pin is where, as they will be hard to see once inserted into the breadboard. There is also text on the positive side of the buzzer, along with a tiny (+) symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ButtonConnections](images/sik-demo-prj2-cb-button-cons.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the button's legs don't line up with the slots on the breadboard, rotate it 90 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to start hooking everything up? Check out the circuit diagram and hookup table below to see how everything is connected.\n",
