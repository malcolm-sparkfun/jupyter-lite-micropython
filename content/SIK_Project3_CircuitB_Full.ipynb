    "# Project 3 - Circuit 3B: Distance Sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance sensors are amazing tools with all kinds of uses. They can sense the presence of an object, they can be used in experiments to calculate speed and acceleration, and they can be used in robotics to avoid obstacles. This circuit will walk you through the basics of using an ultrasonic distance sensor, which measures distance using sound waves!\n",

    "\n",
    "## New Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ultrasonic Distance Sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance sensors work by sending pulses of light or sound out from a transmitter, then timing how long it takes for the signals to bounce off an object and return to a receiver (just like sonar). Some sensors use infrared light, some use lasers, and some, like the [HC-SR04](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13959) included in your kit, use ultrasonic sound (sound so high-pitched that you can’t hear it).\n",

    "\n",
    "## New Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasheets\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with electronics, [datasheets](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/223) are your best friend. Datasheets contain all the relevant information needed to get you up and running with a part. In this circuit, we are calculating distance based on the time it takes sound waves to be transmitted, bounce off an object and then be received. But, how can we tell distance from that information? The answer lies in the [datasheet for the distance sensor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf). In it, you can find the equation the program needs to interpret distance from the time it takes the sound wave to travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elif Statements\n",
    "In the night-light circuit, you used an **if/else statement** to run one set of code when a logic statement was true, and a different set of code when it was false. What if you wanted to have more than two options? [Elif statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements) (short for \"else if\") let you run as many logical tests as you want in one if statement. For example, in the code for this circuit, there is an **if** statement that flows like this:\n",
    "1. **If** the distance is less than 10, make the RGB LED red.\n",
    "2. **Elif** the distance is more than 10 but less than 20, make the RGB LED yellow.\n",
    "3. **Else** make the RGB LED green.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to have four or five colors for different distances, you could add more **elif** statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elif** statements are different from nested **if** statements in that only one of the statements above can be true, whereas you could have multiple nested **if** statements that could be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Hookup\n",
    " ⚠️ **Warning For Polarized Components**: Pay special attention to the component’s markings indicating how to place it on the breadboard. Polarized components can only be connected to a circuit in one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance sensor is polarized. Take note of the pin labels when connecting your circuit.\n",
